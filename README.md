# Hello-World
A repository for practicing Git-Hub flow.
My full name is Bradley Jay Caffee, but I generally go by "Brad." "Jay" is the most confusing part of my spoken full name because it sounds identical to the initial. "Caffee" is often misheard as "Coffee" or "Cathy." I will tell people, "It's like coffee, but with an a." Some people have guessed that my surname is German, since it sounds identical to "Kaffee," which is the German word for coffee. It isn't, but rather Irish, derived from "McCaffrey" or "Caffrey." It was Americanized as "Caffee." Interestingly, "McCaffrey" or "Caffrey" likey came from "Godfrey," a Franco-Norman name. Norman conquerors and all of that.
